The application name is Owee. Why Owee?
This is the first name i came up with, but it can change. 
Basically this is the a neologism derive from the verb "to owe" someone.
An owee is a representation of an object that someone lend to another person. It defines all the propeties and actions of the object it's like a blueprint.
Let's take an example to clarify the idea.

Bob lended $10 to Amir on july the 1st.

Here the the owee represent
- the type of object Bob lended to Amir: money 
- the value: $10
- when it started: july the 1st of 2014
- the due date: optional
- who he lended to : Amir
- the status about what he lended: Still lended or Given back 
- a private notes about what he lended or about Amir: "Amir tends to forget remind him about the money"(optional)
- an email: Amir's email

Bob is also able to perform some action with the owee.
- He can ask the owee to change its status whenever the stuff is given back
- He can ask the owee to remind nicely Amir that he still have the stuff


The core of the project will use python as model combine with some html, javascript, css for the view.

1/ Create a class called Owee as the blueprint.
Owee instance variables:
- ID: unique id to easily retrieve the object
- name: name of the person owing the the
- email: email (string)
- the type of thing he lended (string)
- the value: string
- start: the day he lended the stuff
- end: the day he has to give it back (string)
- status: default set as still lended (string)
- note : note comment about the stuff he lended (string)

Owee instance method:
- reminder : it will send an nice email to remind him that he still have it
- change status: it will change the status from still lended to back and vice versa
- 

2/ Create a dashboard.py file.
dashboard is design to be a module to be use by launcher.py 
This is where helper functions to will be added:
-add owee
-delete owee
-display owee
-change status
-send a reminder
This file will open a a webpage displaying all the owees.
The file contains a function that as parameters a list of owee, then it dynamically generate a dashboard in html form opened in a web browser.
The first step is to build a html template.
Then fill the place holder with dynamic content each time an owee is added.

3/ Create laucher.py (as application controller)
Everything will be put together here.This file will import both owwe.py and dashboard.py, launcher.py represents the controller of the application where function from the dashobard.py
