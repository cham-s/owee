For a long period of time i used to lend some stuff (money, clothes and more) to a friend or a neighbour with the goal of having the stuff back after some time.

The problem that would appear is that after some time, you're not sure about what exactly you lent
and to whom, when it happened and maybe you were hopping to have the stuff back at a specific time.
Naturally you will feel stupid, frustrated, and sometimes a sentiment of anger will raise.

The only thing left is to find a solution to get this right and always be aware of  what happened to all my stuff.

I decided to tackle the problem by building an application that will easily keep track of all the objects i lent.
